        <span class="function-eq">Transformed: g(x) = 0.158 * f( 0.598(x + 0.89) ) + 0.47</span>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 0.9em; word-wrap: break-word;">
        Full g(x) = 0.158 • ( [0.598(x+0.89)]³ + [0.598(x+0.89)]² - 7[0.598(x+0.89)] ) + 0.47
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The parent cubic function, f(x) = x³ + x² - 7x, was transformed to model the motion of a roller coaster in Disney Park. The image shows a section of the ride’s shape featuring an uphill followed by a steep downhill, representing the thrill and motion of the coaster.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specific parent function was chosen precisely because its natural shape already includes this "uphill-then-downhill" curve. The transformations were then applied to scale and position this shape onto the real track.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was vertically compressed by a factor of 0.158 (a = 0.158). This positive 'a' value reduces the steepness of the parent function's curve to reflect the gentler slope visible in the real track. A horizontal stretch by a factor of 1.672 (k ≈ 0.598) widens the curve, matching the long, smooth transition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the function was translated 0.89 units to the left (d = -0.89) and 0.47 units upward (c = 0.47), aligning the function's peak with the coaster’s base level. Together, these transformations allow the cubic function to realistically represent the roller coaster’s shape.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container w3-white w3-padding-32 w3-card">
      <h3>Domain and Range</h3>
      <p>
        The domain of this polynomial function is approximately -6 < x < -1.7, representing the section of the 
        roller coaster track shown in the image — from the point where the train begins to climb the hill to where 
        it finishes descending.
      </p>
      <p>
        The range corresponds to the height of the roller coaster in this portion of the 
        track. The graph shows the coaster rising from a low point of about 0.5 to its highest point at 5.0. Therefore, the range is 0.5 < y < 5.0.

        <span class="function-eq">Transformed Function: g(x) = -1.3|x - 1| + 3.3</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The parent absolute value function was transformed to model the support frame of the pirate ship ride, 
        whose structure forms a tall, symmetrical “V” shape supporting the swinging motion of the ship. 
        The graph is reflected vertically because the leading coefficient is negative (a = -1.3), flipping 
        the parent function downward to resemble the beams hanging from the central pivot.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is vertically stretched by a factor of 1.3, making the “V” shape steeper and more representative 
        of the long, angled metal beams that rise from the ground to hold the ship. The graph is then 
        translated 1 unit to the right (d = 1), positioning the vertex directly beneath the central pivot of the ride, 
        and shifted 3.3 units upward (c = 3.3) so the vertex sits at its correct height, consistent with the actual structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these transformations allow the absolute value function to accurately model the geometric symmetry, slope, and position of the pirate ship’s support frame in real life.

      <h3>Domain and Range</h3>
      <p>
        The domain of this function is -4 < x < 5, representing the horizontal span of the two supporting 
        beams. The range is limited to -3.2 ≤ y ≤ 3.3, representing the vertical positions of the frame, from its lowest points on the ground to its high pivot point.

        <span class="function-eq">Transformed Function: g(x) = 1.5sin(0.45(x + 2.8)) - 0.5</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The parent sine function was transformed to model the top section of a roller coaster track, where the curve reaches its highest peak before descending. The graph is vertically stretched by a factor of 1.5 (a = 1.5), making the wave taller and emphasizing the rise and fall of the coaster’s motion. It is also horizontally stretched by a factor of about 2.22 (k = 0.45), which lengthens the curve to match the wider, gentler slope of the coaster’s upper track.
      </p>
      <p>
        The function is shifted 2.8 units to the left (d = -2.8), aligning the highest point near the center of the structure, and moved downward by 0.5 units (c = -0.5) to set the center-line of the wave. Together, these transformations create a smooth, elevated sine wave that represents the top arc of the roller coaster.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container w3-white w3-padding-32 w3-card">
      <h3>Domain and Range</h3>
      <p>
        The domain of this function is -5 < x < 5, representing the horizontal distance covered by the top portion of the roller coaster track.
      </p>
      <p>
        The range is determined by the amplitude and vertical shift. The center-line is at y = -0.5 and the amplitude is 1.5, so the range is limited to -1.75 ≤ y ≤ 1 (calculated from -0.5 - 1.5 up to -0.5 + 1.5). This corresponds to the full vertical height of the coaster’s upper path.

      </p>
      <p>
        The parent exponential function f(x) = 2ˣ was transformed to model a section of a roller coaster track, showing a gradual drop. The graph is vertically reflected and compressed by a factor of 0.2 (a = -0.2), which flips the curve downward and reduces its steepness to match the physical slope of the track.
      </p>
      <p>
        A horizontal stretch by a factor of approximately 3.33 (k = 0.3) widens the curve, elongating the drop to represent the smoother motion of the coaster. The graph is shifted 18.1 units to the left (d = -18.1) and translated upward by 6.9 units (c = 6.9) so that the track sits at the correct vertical height. Together, these transformations create an exponential curve that realistically models the shape and slope of this portion of the roller coaster.

      </p>
      <p>
        The parent square root function f(x) = √x was transformed to model the descending section of the roller coaster track, where the ride slopes downward from a higher point. The graph is vertically stretched by a factor of 2.3 (a = 2.3), making the descent steeper to match the physical slope of the track. The negative horizontal factor (k = -1.3) reflects the graph across the vertical axis and compresses it horizontally, reversing the direction so that the slope goes downward.
      </p>
      <p>
        The function is shifted horizontally by 5.2 units (d = 5.2) to align the start of the descent with the correct position along the track, and vertically translated downward by 6.3 units (c = -6.3), setting the height of the track relative to the base level. These transformations together produce a realistic curve representing the slanted, downward portion of the roller coaster.

        The domain of this function is -5 < x < 4.2, representing the horizontal span of the descending section of the roller coaster track. The range is limited to approximately –3.678 ≤ y ≤ 2.077, corresponding to the vertical heights along this segment from the top of the descent down to the lowest point.
