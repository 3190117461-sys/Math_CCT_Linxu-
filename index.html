  <!-- Transformations Paragraph -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-white w3-padding-32 w3-margin-top w3-card">
    <h2>Transformations</h2>
    <p>
      The parent cubic function was transformed to model the motion of a roller coaster in Disney Park. 
      The image I used shows a section of the ride’s track featuring an uphill followed by a steep downhill, 
      representing the thrill and motion of the coaster. Because the leading coefficient is negative, 
      the graph opens downward, symbolizing the initial drop after the peak.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was vertically compressed by a factor of 0.158, reducing the steepness of the curve to reflect 
      the gentler slope visible in the real track. A horizontal stretch by a factor of 1.672 widens the curve, 
      matching the long, smooth transition of the coaster’s motion. The function was also translated 0.89 units 
      to the left and 0.47 units upward, aligning its lowest point with the coaster’s base level and starting 
      platform shown in the image. Together, these transformations allow the cubic function (a polynomial of 
      degree higher than two) to realistically represent the roller coaster’s shape and movement. This visualization 
      connects mathematical modeling to a real-world structure, showing how polynomial functions can describe 
      physical motion in amusement park rides.

  <!-- Domain and Range Paragraph -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-white w3-padding-32 w3-margin-top w3-card">
    <h2>Domain and Range</h2>
    <p>
      The domain of this polynomial function is approximately −6 &lt; x &lt; −1.7, representing the section of the 
      roller coaster track shown in the image — from the point where the train begins to climb the hill to where 
      it finishes descending. The range corresponds to the height of the roller coaster in this portion of the 
      track, showing how the coaster rises to its highest point and then drops back down. This limited domain focuses 
      on one realistic part of the ride rather than the entire function, emphasizing how the curve models a smooth 
      and continuous physical motion.
