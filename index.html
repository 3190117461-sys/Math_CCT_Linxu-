      <h3>Transformations</h3>
      <p>
        The parent cubic function was transformed to model the motion of a roller coaster in Disney Park. 
        The image I used shows a section of the ride’s track featuring an uphill followed by a steep downhill, 
        representing the thrill and motion of the coaster. Because the leading coefficient is negative, 
        the graph opens downward, symbolizing the initial drop after the peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was vertically compressed by a factor of 0.158, reducing the steepness of the curve to reflect 
        the gentler slope visible in the real track. A horizontal stretch by a factor of 1.672 widens the curve, 
        matching the long, smooth transition of the coaster’s motion. The function was also translated 0.89 units 
        to the left and 0.47 units upward, aligning its lowest point with the coaster’s base level and starting 
        platform shown in the image. Together, these transformations allow the cubic function (a polynomial of 
        degree higher than two) to realistically represent the roller coaster’s shape and movement.

    <!-- Domain and Range Paragraph -->

      <h3>Domain and Range</h3>
      <p>
        The domain of this polynomial function is approximately −6 &lt; x &lt; −1.7, representing the section of the 
        roller coaster track shown in the image — from the point where the train begins to climb the hill to where 
        it finishes descending. The range corresponds to the height of the roller coaster in this portion of the 
        track, showing how the coaster rises to its highest point and then drops back down. This limited domain focuses 
        on one realistic part of the ride rather than the entire function, emphasizing how the curve models a smooth 
        and continuous physical motion.

      <h3>Transformations</h3>
      <p>
        The parent absolute value function was transformed to model the support frame of the pirate ship ride, 
        whose structure forms a tall, symmetrical “V” shape supporting the swinging motion of the ship. 
        The graph is reflected vertically because the leading coefficient is negative (a = -1.3), flipping 
        the parent function downward to resemble the point where the two beams meet at the base of the frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is vertically stretched by a factor of 1.3, making the “V” shape steeper and more representative 
        of the long, angled metal beams that rise from the ground to hold the ship. The graph is then 
        translated 1 unit to the right, positioning the vertex directly beneath the central pivot of the ride, 
        and shifted 3.3 units upward so the lowest point sits above ground level, consistent with the actual structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these transformations (reflection, vertical stretch, and translations) allow the absolute 
        value function to accurately model the geometric symmetry, slope, and position of the pirate ship’s 
        support frame in real life.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Domain and Range Paragraph -->
    <div class="w3-container w3-white w3-padding-32 w3-card">
      <h3>Domain and Range</h3>
      <p>
        The domain of this function is −4 &lt; x &lt; 5, representing the horizontal span of the two supporting 
        beams that extend outward from the central pivot of the pirate ship. This restricted domain models 
        only the visible section of the frame instead of the full infinite graph of the parent function.
      </p>
      <p>
        The range is limited as well, since the real support structure has a fixed height. The vertex of the 
        graph reaches a maximum height of y = 3.3, and the lowest visible points of the beams reach about 
        y = −3.2. Therefore, the range can be expressed as −3.2 ≤ y ≤ 3.3. This restricted range accurately 
        represents the vertical extent of the pirate ship’s support frame, showing how the mathematical model 
        captures a realistic physical structure rather than an infinite function.

      <h3>Transformations</h3>
      <p>
        The parent sine function was transformed to model the top section of a roller coaster track, where the curve reaches its highest peak before descending. The graph is vertically stretched by a factor of 1.5, making the wave taller and emphasizing the rise and fall of the coaster’s motion. It is also horizontally stretched by a factor of about 2.22 (since k = 0.45), which lengthens the curve to match the wider, gentler slope of the coaster’s upper track.
      </p>
      <p>
        The function is shifted 2.8 units to the left, aligning the highest point near the center of the structure, and moved downward by 0.5 units so that the peak remains within a realistic height range for the model. Together, these transformations create a smooth, elevated sine wave that represents the top arc of the roller coaster, showing the point where the ride transitions from climbing to dropping.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Domain and Range Paragraph -->
    <div class="w3-container w3-white w3-padding-32 w3-card">
      <h3>Domain and Range</h3>
      <p>
        The domain of this function is -5 &lt; x &lt; 5, representing the horizontal distance covered by the top portion of the roller coaster track. This restricted domain focuses only on the visible section of the ride—the crest—rather than the infinitely repeating sine wave of the parent function.
      </p>
      <p>
        The range is limited to -5 ≤ y ≤ 1, which corresponds to the vertical height of the coaster’s upper path. Here, y = 1 represents the highest point of the ride, while y = -5 indicates the lowest visible part of this segment. This confined range accurately reflects the physical limits of the roller coaster’s top arc, ensuring that the mathematical model matches a real-world structure instead of an endless wave.
